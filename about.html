                    I am a student currently attending the University of Michigan College of 
                    Engineering with a major in Computer Science. I am currently looking for a internship position
                    primarily in programming or web development.

                    As a software developer for the University of Michigan Solar Car team, I work to develop tools and come up with
                    creative solutions to problems that need to be solved in order to win the World and American Solar Challenges. 
                    I am currently working on implementing genetic algorithms to optimize race simulations.
                    <br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy running and playing video games such as League of Legends with friends.
